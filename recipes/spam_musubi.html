            Cook rice: Place the rice in a fine mesh colander & rinse it well with hot water until the water runs clear. drain excess water from the rice then transfer it to a rice pot. Cover & cook.
            Once the rice is done, let it steam and rest for 5-10 minutes before assembling Spam Musubi.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare the teryaki sauce: Combine 1/3 cup dark brown sugar, 3 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons mirin, and 1 teaspoon sesame oil in a small bowl whisking to combine.
            Microwave for 30 sec to a minute to dissolve the sugar. Let it sit aside to cool slightly. 
         </li>
        <li>
            Pan-fry the Spam and glaze with the teriaki sauce: Place a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. add some nonstick spray to the pan and arrange the slice Spam in a single layer in the skillet.
            Cook 4-5 minutes until lightly browned. Flip the Spam, reduce the heat to medium-low. Spoon 1 tablespoon of teryaki sauce over each slice of spam.
            Cook for another 2-3 minutes. Repeat until spam is as browned and saucy as you like. Remove from heat and set aside for Spam Musubi assembly.

            Prep the nori and nusubi mold: place a large piece of plastic wrap or wax paper on your work surface. Grab a Piece of sushi nori and place on work space. Place the outer box of the musubi mold on the center of the nori
             such that its long edge runs parallel with the longer sides of the nori.
        </li>
        <li>
            Build the Spam musubi: Use a rice paddle to scrape a small amount of rice off the top of the rice pot. Gently add the rice to the musubi mold, filling it almost entirely full. As you fill the mold, use the edge of the rice paddle to gently pat the rice down 
            into a uniform level but, avoid pressing down on the rice to much. Once the mold is filled with rice, sprinkle a generous amount of furikake seasoning over top. Arrange a slice of the teriyaki spam in the mold.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble and wrap the Spam Musubi: Place the Musubi mold lid on top of the Spam. Press down firmly, starting at the center and then going around the edges. Once done pressing keep the lid on top and use your other fingers to slide the mold 
            up past the lid. remove the lid and gently but firmly fold the nori over the spam. Pat some water on the nori on top of the spam and fold the other half over the spam. Flip the musubi over on top of the seam and let it sit. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat steps 4-6 with remaining rice and teriyaki spam. Once done it is ready to serve! To store, wrap musubi in plastic and place in the fridge to eat later.

        Instructions
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pour neutral oil into a large skillet, just enough to submerge the beans (about 1/2 - 1 inches). Heat the oil over hight heat, 
            it should be around 350 degrees. To test temperature of the oil, drop a bean into the skillet. It should start to sizzle immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the oil is hot, add a a handful of beans and fry until you see wrinkling and blistering on the skin, it should take 1-2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the beans with a slotted spoon or tongs and set aside on a paper line plate. Repeat with the remaining green beans. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove all but 1 TBSP oil from the pan and reduce the heat to medium. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the broth 
            concentrate and water and stir to combine. Return the green beans to the pan and cook for 30 seconds longer. Season with salt and drizzle with chili oil if desired.
